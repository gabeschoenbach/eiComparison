## EI Comparisons
This is a repo documenting an investigation into how the choices one makes when running EI can affect one's final results.

There are three dimensions upon which we can choose two options:
* Region size: (Statewide / by-County)
* Combining racial categories: (Separate White, Other / Combine White + Other)
* Handling turnout: (Abstain is candidate / Do two-phase)
